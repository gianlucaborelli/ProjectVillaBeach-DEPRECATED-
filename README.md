## About this Project 

This project aims to assist in the management of a company called **VillaBeach** located in the city of [Brodowski](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brodowski,+SP,+14340-000/@-20.9915545,-47.6566512,14), in the countryside of the State of São Paulo, and its core business is a gym environment with a beach volleyball court joined together with a pub and recreation environment. 

With the full consent of the company's owners, this project will not have the purpose of selling and monetization, being fully developed to practice my knowledge and compose my portfolio.

## Why? 

The development of this project is carried out during my free time and during my studies, and was conceived after understanding the needs of a co-worker regarding the difficulties he has been facing in controlling the finances of his private bussiness.

## Some Observations about this App 

**1 -** Despite not being part of my professional interest (UX/UI), I was extremely uncomfortable with the appearance of the standard TextBox of the .Net Framework together with the Flat Design chosen as User Interface.

![Standard TextBox](https://github.com/gianlucaborelli/ProjectVillaBeach/blob/main/Pictures/Standard%20TextBox.jpg) 

Therefore, I created a component called  [FlatTextBox](https://github.com/gianlucaborelli/ProjectVillaBeach/tree/main/ProjetoVillaBeach/Controles/FlatTextBoxControler) using the UserControl class, which makes aesthetic changes to the standard TextBox, and implements several other features, for example:

- Validation of data entered in the TextBox, according to the type of validation selected during system construction (such as C.P.F., C.N.P.J. and others).

- Validation if the component is mandatory.

In addition to other minor internal behaviors.
